# 🧭 AIM: 

To study and implement Operators in C++

# 🖥️ SOFTWARE REQUIRED: 

Visual Studio

# 📚 THEORY: 

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. C++ is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types:

ARITHMETIC OPERATORS: These are basic operators used for arithmetic operations between operands. They include:

+ for addition

- for subtraction

* for multiplication

/ for division

% for modulus These operators are essential for performing calculations and manipulating data within a program.

RELATIONAL OPERATORS: These are used to compare two values or expressions and return a boolean result:

== checks if two values are equal

!= checks if values are not equal

> checks if the left value is greater than the right

< checks if the left value is less than the right

>= and <= check for greater-than-or-equal-to and less-than-or-equal-to They are vital for making decisions and controlling the flow of programs based on conditions.

LOGICAL OPERATORS: Logical operators operate on boolean values and include:

&& (logical AND): Returns true only if both operands are true

|| (logical OR): Returns true if at least one operand is true

! (logical NOT): Inverts the truth value These operators help in constructing compound conditions for decision-making and control flow.

BITWISE OPERATORS: These manipulate individual bits of integer values and include:

& (AND)

| (OR)

^ (XOR)

~ (NOT)

<< (left shift)

>> (right shift) Bitwise operations are useful in system-level programming, cryptography, and optimization tasks.

ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS: These assign values to variables. The basic assignment operator is =, but C++ also supports compound forms:

+=, -=, *=, /=, %=, etc., which combine an arithmetic operation with assignment

# 🧪 IMPLEMENTATION: 

In this practical, I applied different types of operators in the following scenarios:

# 🔍 Positive or Negative Number Check: 

Comparison operators were used to evaluate whether a number entered by the user is negative or positive.

# 📚 Student Grade Determination: 

A combination of comparison and logical operators was used to calculate the average of marks in five subjects and assign a grade accordingly.

# 🧭 Quadrant Determination: 

Coordinates provided by the user were processed using comparison and logical operators to determine the quadrant in a Cartesian plane where the point lies.

# ✅ CONCLUSION: 

I explored various types of operators in C++ and understood how each operator contributes to decision-making, computation, and program control.
